My Java Application Deployment on Kubernetes
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Java application on Kubernetes, with features including data storage in an internal volume, three replicas for high availability, and load balancing for traffic distribution.

Prerequisites
Kubernetes Cluster: Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy your application.
Docker Image: Prepare a Docker image for your Java application and push it to a Docker registry accessible from your Kubernetes cluster.
Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): Make sure to set up a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for storing data internally. Modify the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim sections in the provided Kubernetes YAML files (deployment.yaml and service.yaml) according to your storage requirements.
Deployment Steps
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/my-java-app-k8s.git
cd my-java-app-k8s
Modify the Kubernetes YAML files (deployment.yaml and service.yaml) as needed. Replace your-java-image:tag with the actual Docker image name and tag for your Java application.
Apply the Kubernetes resources:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Verify the deployment:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
Ensure that all pods are running and the service is available with an external IP (if using a cloud provider's LoadBalancer).
Accessing the Application
Once the deployment is successful and the service has an external IP (for LoadBalancer type), you can access your Java application using the provided IP and port.

Example:

arduino
Copy code
http://<external-ip>:80
Cleaning Up
To clean up the resources created by this deployment, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
kubectl delete deployment myapp-deployment
kubectl delete service myapp-service
kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim myapp-pvc
kubectl delete persistentvolume myapp-pv
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment or while accessing the application, refer to the Kubernetes logs and events for troubleshooting. You can also reach out to the project maintainers for support.
